<p>I don't mind telling you that I find this a bit scary.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gotripod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pylons.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1529" title="pylons" src="http://www.gotripod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pylons.png" alt="" width="674" height="281" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The figures can be placed into different poses, with the suggestion that the landscapes could inform the position that the sculpture is placed into. For example, as a power lineÂ ascends a hill, the pylons could look as if they're climbing. The figures could also stretch up to gain increased height over longer spans.</p>
<p>"Subtle alterations in the hands and head combined with repositioning of the main body parts in the x, y and z-axis, allow for a rich variety of expressions. The pylon-figures can be placed in pairs, walking in the same direction or opposite directions, glancing at each other as they pass by or kneeling respectively, head bowed at a town," said the architects.</p></blockquote>
<p>And at night they lay down their electrical burden to eat your children. <a title="Run for the hills" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/16/human-pylons" target="_blank">Wired has more on these metal monsters</a>.</p>
