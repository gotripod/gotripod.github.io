    2.5.1.  In the write-post part (post_new.php), when I click on a thumbnail, it
    gives a JS error saying "$ is not a function"

  content: I think this may be an issue with a conflict between Prototype.js javascript
    framework and one you are using with another plug-in. I will look into whether
    I can make prototype work in a compatibility mode or whether I can use JQuery
    (packaged with wordpress) to make the AJAX calls to update the thumbnails

  content: ! 'Hello!


    Great plugin, but I found a problem with the newest version 1.6 on WP 2.3.3. When
    I try to add a custom field to a static page or a post, I get the error message
    "You don''t have permission to do that." and the field is not added.


    I tried it with WP 2.3.3 without any plugins and it worked. I tried it with WP-Flickr
    1.1 and it still worked. Then I updated the plugin to 1.6 and the error showed
    up again. I guess it has something to do with your changes to the AJAX stuff.
    Any advice how to solve this would be appreciated. :-)


    Greetings,

    Johannes'

    The concept behind the add-on is fantastic, would love to be able to use it on

    Sounds like this is related to your issue with TinyMCE. The plugin wouldn''t authenticate

    TinyMCE api to insert the images.'

  content: I love this plugin. It has worked well until after upgrading to WP2.6.
    The text wrap function is not functioning any longer. I have deleted and re-uploaded
    the plugin files and no result. I had also embedded a video call script directly
    into the html of the post from Google video. I have noticed that these direct
    embeds are very unstable. Maybe the video embed is somehow interfering with the
    plugin operability. Any help you can offer is much appreciated.

<p>Just to let you all know I have updated WP-Flcikr, making it compatible with WordPress 2.5</p>
<p>As part of the update, I have fixed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with WordPress 2.5</li>
<li>Issue where users without curl installed would get an error authenticating</li>
<li>Updated the style to match WordPress 2.5</li>
<li>AJAX enabled the plugin to stop the page refresh (which ws incompatible with WordPress 2.5) when switching Photo Sets on the write/edit post page</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3214/2449667775_76fc86e339.jpg" alt="wp-flickr" /></p>
<p>If you are using WordPress 2.5, you can automatically upgrade to the latest version from the plugins page. If you are not already using WP-Flickr, you can download it here <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-flickr/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-flickr/</a></p>
