<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I apologise about the lack of post recently I have a backlog of things to post about in the near future as soon as I migrate my blog to the excellent Mephisto blog engine. As part of the move I will be giving my site a facelift so check back soon. My feed address will remain as <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/miletbaker">http://feeds.feedburner.com/miletbaker</a> so feel free to subscribe in the meantime.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jon</p>
