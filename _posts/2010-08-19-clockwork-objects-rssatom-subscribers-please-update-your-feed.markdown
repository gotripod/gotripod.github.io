<p>This is a quick post to all my old subscribers of my personal Clockwork Objects blog. The old Google Feedburner feed from that site has been deleted and redirected to our GoTripod blog. Google will maintain the redirect for 30 days after which point if you would like to continue receiving our exciting content you will need to check/update your subscription feed to unsure it points to <a href="http://www.gotripod.com/feed/rss">http://www.gotripod.com/feed/rss</a></p>
<p>Thanks, Jon</p>
