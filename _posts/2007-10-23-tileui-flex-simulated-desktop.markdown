<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-335"></a>Doug was interviewed about this on the <a href="http://flex.org/community/">Flex.org Podcast</a> In which I believe he stated that he made use of Papervision3D combined with <span class="caps">APE</span>.</p>
<p>You can easily group items, by holding down the left-mouse button and dragging around the items you want to group. By default these stack but when you hold the mouse button down to group a blue circle appears, if you return here and hover with the mouse button still down, you get the menu shown above, where you can then spiral the stack, or arrange them in a messy formation.</p>
<p>Once items are stacked, you can double click them for further options, but I'll let you play and discover these yourselves.</p>
<p>I believe Doug based this on an another application, details of which are in the interview in the <a href="http://flex.org/community/">Flex.org Podcast</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the demo Doug.</p>
