<p>I have migrated my blog from <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> to <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Wordpress</a>. Before I get flamed for this, please let me apologise for any broken links. Any articles written in Mephisto (after August 2007) should be fine as I have set WordPress up to use the same style Permalinks, however any written in my .Net blog engine previous to that will now get my error page. I have tried to make this page as helpful as possible by providing a search facility.</p>
<p>My reasoning in moving to WordPress is not a reflection on Mephisto as it is an excellent blogging platform, however more to do with ease of deployment and hosting a PHP based system over a RubyÂ  on Railsbased system.</p>
<p>Once again I apologise if you are unable to find the article you are looking for, you should be able to locate it through the search facility or using the Categories or tags (on the left).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jon</p>
