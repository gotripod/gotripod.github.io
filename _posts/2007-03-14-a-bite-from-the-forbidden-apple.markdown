  content: Many .NET developers should be familiar with the fact that applications
    don't terminate when you press the X button, that is if they have developed applications
    for Windows Mobile. (Although this behavior has changed in WM6).    And .NET developers
    have the advantage of being to start developing applications  for Mac without
    having to learn some new language or method of programming.  They'll have to familiarize
    themselves with some specific MacOS libraries at most. I'm talking about Mono
    of course.    A good alternative (don't know if it's better) for Parallels is
    VMWare Fusion,  which I use for Visual Studio (I admit, nothing beats Visual Studio)
    and iWork '08  provides a nice (but different) alternative to Microsoft Word,
    Powerpoint and Excel.    When I first transfered to Mac I found myself asking
    "What's so good about it, what's the big fuzz..." and it took me a while but in
    the end I was seduced by  the Mac side and now I wouldn't be able to live without
    my Mac.  (Like you said,

<p>As a .Net developer, I am probably the last sort of person that would leave the world of Microsoft Windows based PCs in favor of an Apple Mac. But I have successfully made the transition and wanted to share my experiences with any other .Net / would be Apple fans.</p>
<p>I had been deliberating for a good year whether to buy a mac or not. I originally had no intention of leaving my PC altogether and though that it would be nice to have a Mac (maybe a Mac Mini) for the more creative / design aspects of my work. But now, having used a Mac for the design side it is true that the Mac fits the design role better than a PC, for a start the operating system is beautifully designed and therefore inspires the same in your own work. On top of that it displays colour more accurately and printed material looks the same colour as it does on screen. Other features just make working faster such as when clicking the middle mighty mouse button accesses Exposé, which allows very rapid switching between programs. Dragging files around is a joy, you automatically drill down into directories as you hover over icons and the list goes on. To the point, in fact, that I can't go back, I have sold my PC and am based 100% on Macs. So where does that leave me as a .Net developer.</p>
<p>Well thanks to the Intel processors in Macs, running windows when needed is a breeze, in fact I would swear in runs Windows faster than on my PC, even in Parallels (virtualisation software like Virtual PC or VMWare but that can display running applications on the Mac OS desktop rather than within a host window). Once Parallels is running, when I open Visual Studio 2005 Professional it seems to open instantly and is very workable, even on my MacBook. So now I can design my web sites’ look and feel in Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> and then when ready to code in asp.net, boot up Parallels and work in Windows giving me the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The transition wasn’t as easy as Apple like to make out. For a start you have to look at computing in a new way. When George Cook, a friend of mine who also recently made the jump, advised me to switch to Mac, he described the problems I encountered "like the matrix, your eyes are open but you are not seeing". Which is very true when you switch to Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> you have to stop treating it like a PC. For example, with Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> when you click the red X in a window’s title bar, you don’t actually close the application, just the window, which can be very confusing for a windows user and your first reaction may be to try and kill it (either by pressing Apple-Q or by holding the mouse button over it’s icon in the launcher and selecting quit), but you don’t need to. This is Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> and it is designed to have these applications left running. So for example when you next open iTunes, Firefox etc they open instantly, and amazingly it does not seem to impact performance (Although iPhoto seems to struggle). Getting emails over from Outlook on my PC was a challenge but I succeeded in the end (using <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></span>) but in the end it has all been worth it and I have not looked back.</p>
<p>So I can recommend to anyone who would like to go Mac but feel that cannot as they are .Net developers, to go for it. I have had no regrets and for any Windows only software you can just boot into Parallels. I recommend you still keep your Windows copy of Microsoft Office on your Parallels based Windows, as Mac Office 2004 is not designed for Intel Macs so crawls along. Also there does not seem to be an official port of OpenOffice to Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> but Neo Office is not bad if you really don’t want to run office in a virtual machine.</p>
