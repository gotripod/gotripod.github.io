  content: Hostgator does this too for their 404 pages.  Pretty innovative technique.

  content: ! 'Great idea!


    Maybe they could add a sentence like:

    And if you email us the link you tried you will double the value of the coupon
    ...


    This way they fix their broken sites ...


    Regards,

<p>I came across <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/book/">a great 404 page</a> the other day and thought I would share it. The page at first glances looks like any other but if you read the text, you will see that they have redeemed themselves for the broken link by offering me a discount of $3 off any of their products.</p>
<p><img class="s3-img" style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://clockobj.co.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/Picture 1.png" border="0" alt="Picture 1.png" width="477" height="439" /></p>
<p>This is a great way to capture the interest of would be browsers that would normally see this page and immediately hit the back key, instead not only do they capture my attention, but they also tap into my curiosity which gets me to immediately click the products link.</p>
<p>In this case I didn't need any of their products but this is a great tip.</p>
<p>Also note the search bar being visible. This is essential on a 404 page for keeping customers that know what they are looking for on your site.</p>
