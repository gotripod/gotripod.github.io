title: We Like React Native
---

Colin's started [playing around](http://colinramsay.co.uk/2015/03/27/react-native-simple-native-module.html) with the new [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) from Facebook, a way of building native-speed applications for iOS using JavaScript. It's aa completely new approach and we're really excited about it - follow Colin's experiments over at his [personal blog](http://colinramsay.co.uk/2015/03/27/react-native-simple-native-module.html).
