<p>Go Tripod is growing and as part of that expansion we are looking to take on a Digital Project Manager to join our team and continue our mission in creating web and mobile applications that although technically complex are elegantly simple to use, intuitive and visually stunning.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking a experienced and talented freelance/permanent digital project manager to join our team. Although we advocate remote working you will need to be available to work predominantly from our central Truro office. You must have at least 2 years experience, working on the full lifecycle of digital projects for various types of clients in a creative and fast paced environment.</p>
<p>We expect the following from the successful candidate:</p>
<p><strong>Communicator</strong></p>
<p>You will be a people person who is happy to pick up the phone, as well as travel and have face to face meetings with our clients. You will also need the ability to relay information to the technical and creative teams.</p>
<p><strong>Attention to detail</strong></p>
<p>In a large and complex digital project the number of 'moving parts' that need to be co-ordinated and not overlooked can be mind-blowing. Missing just one small thing (oh no, we forgot to change the DNS settings and the site's due to go live in 2 hours!) can jeopardise the whole project; and not to mention all that hard earned client goodwill. We will expect you to be dotting the I’s, crossing the T’s and stewarding things over the line.</p>
<p><strong>Enabler</strong></p>
<p>It's stating the obvious — but needs frequently repeating nonetheless — project management is a means to an end not an end in itself. You will organise the schedule so that our developers and designers can have decent blocks of time to work collaboratively on a project whilst at the same time keeping all the other projects in the schedule moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Methodologies</strong></p>
<p>A good grasp of the main project management methodologies (e.g. waterfall and agile) and an understanding of their pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong>Scoping</strong></p>
<p>You will know what functional and technical specs look like — and even contribute parts of the spec themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Technical know-how</strong></p>
<p>It helps enormously if you are not totally out of your depth when developers start talking tech. At a conceptual level, you need to feel comfortable with the main front and back end technical terminology (e.g. HTML/CSS, AJAX, CMS systems, relational databases, APIs etc) . Ideally you will have a good understanding of other key technical areas such as mobile, accessibility and SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Creative know-how</strong></p>
<p>Core to Go Tripod is the fusion of the technical and the creative. So as well as understanding how developers work, you will know a good deal about the creative process too. Fundamentally, you will appreciate that the creative process doesn't work in straight lines and have worked out how to accommodate this awkward fact into how they run and deliver projects.</p>
<p><strong>Legal</strong></p>
<p>We expect you to have a good overview of the key legal requirements affecting our industry (e.g. Data Protection Act, Disability Discrimination Act).</p>
<p><strong>Attitude</strong></p>
<p>Above all you will have a thirst for knowledge, be enthusiastic, motivated and positive.</p>
<p><strong>Salary / Rate: Negotiable </strong></p>
<p><strong>Interested?</strong></p>
<p>Then please email your CV to jobs@gotripod.com.</p>
<p><strong>NO AGENCIES PLEASE.</strong></p>
