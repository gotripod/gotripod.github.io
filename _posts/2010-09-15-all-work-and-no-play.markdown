<p>Even though the Tripods are normally beavering away with client work or one of our products, we're firm believers in taking time out to relax and have fun to break up the working day and provide an outlet for all the excess energy an office worker builds up. Campaign Monitor are one of our favourite companies and they're famed for including <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/2676/campaign-monitor-goes-to-the-beach/">surfing as a big part of their company</a> ethic.</p>
<p>At Go Tripod, we're lucky enough to be based in Cornwall, UK - home of some of the <a href="http://www.newquaysurfer.org/">best surfing spots in the UK</a>. For something a bit more relaxing, there's always a lazy afternoon of fishing on the cards (<a href="http://www.gotripod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/photo-7.jpg">take a look at our latest catch out of Falmouth Bay</a>).</p>
<p>For my part, I've been spending my evenings running around Falmouth and the surrounding area to blow off some steam and build up my stamina. This Saturday, I'm running a half marathon - the Great North Run - <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/colinramsay-gnr-2010">on behalf of the Stroke Association</a>, and getting up to the 20k mark has been a personal challenge as well as a great way of keeping active over the summer.</p>
<p>Dedication to work is important - but a business without a sense of fun and relaxation is one in which the team members won't be firing on all cylinders.</p>
