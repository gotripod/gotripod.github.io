  content: ! 'I couldn''t agree more. Almost all of the developers I have know would
    consider themselves poor at design but usability design, or user experience (UX),
    is a totally different topic and something that must be done to each project.


    In my opinion almost all of UX is based on asking the right questions. When you
    ask the right UX question then the answer is obvious.'
