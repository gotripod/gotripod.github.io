<blockquote><p>The Ext JS 3.0 Cookbook is for developers who want a book of useful techniques, with explanations, that they can refer to and adapt to their purposes. </p></blockquote>
<p>I was a Technical Reviewer for this book, and it contains not just simple recipes to get you started, but complex ones to allow you to bend Ext JS to your will.
