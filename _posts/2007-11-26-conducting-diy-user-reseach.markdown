<p><a href="http://www.disambiguity.com">Leisa Reichelt</a> has posted up an <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/diy-user-research-my-barcamp-presentation/">interesting presentation on DIY guerrilla User Research</a> which is well worth a look. I have embedded her slideshow below.</p>
<p>She points out that no matter how small the budget, even a small amount of User Research can pay off in a big way. She goes through some of the techniques used by Interaction Designers when conducting research and some invaluable tips on conducting and writing interviews, it is well worth a look:</p>
