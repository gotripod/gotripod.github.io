    If WP-Flickr  works for each author this is will be cool?

  content: ! 'This is a sweet plugin, very nicely done. Some reactions from my use
    so far:


    To be in compliance with flickr''s TOS, shouldn''t the photo be linked back to
    the flickr photo page? It''d be sweet if it automatically did that.


    I use some blogs with multiple authors, but WP-Flickr appears to authenticate
    the entire blog to one flickr account. What do you think about associating the
    flickr credentials with individual users and storing that data in usermeta ?


    Anyway, nice work, and congratulations on your new position with Trigger.'

<p>As part of a recent project, we needed to develop a custom WordPress plugin for our client. They have kindly allowed us to release it under the GNU licence, so if you feel it is useful, please feel free to<a href="http://www.gotripod.com/extras/wp-flickr/"> download and install it</a>. It is loosely based on the similar <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flickr-tag/">Flickr Tag WordPress plugin by Jeffery Maki</a> however rather than parsing the page each time a post is viewed and generating the image tag, this version inserts the image tag directly into the post. In addition you can  browse your Flickr Photostream, Sets and Favorites right from within the WordPress Admin pages, choosing the sizes available on flickr and inserting with a single click.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="http://www.gotripod.com/extras/wp-flickr/">download and try the plugin</a>. It is currently hosted here but once approved for the WordPress Plugin Directory, it will be moved there.</p>
