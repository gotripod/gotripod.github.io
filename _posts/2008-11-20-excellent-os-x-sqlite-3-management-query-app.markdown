<p>iPhone and Adobe Air developers (as well as any others that use SQLite 3) <a href="http://menial.co.uk">Menial</a> has just released an excellent little app for creating, managing and running queries against SQLite 3 databases called Bases.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gotripod.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/schema1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" title="schema1" src="http://www.gotripod.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/schema1.png" alt="" width="500" height="424" /></a></p>
<p>The application is simple to use, very user friendly and has worked well from the testing I have done. It costs just Â£10 and there is a free trial available so you can try before you buy.</p>
