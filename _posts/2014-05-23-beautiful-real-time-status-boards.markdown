##Beautiful Real-Time Status Boards

Ok, so we know that everyone involved with making a business successful needs to understand business intelligence.

This applies not only to the CEO but down to the person packing products to ship. Everyone needs measureable data to understand how well or not so well they are doing.

At Go Tripod we have various requirements to track and measure. Everything from Sales enquiries, pipelines, projects and accouting aspects. We also manage a large array of applications and services with agreed response times when things go wrong.

All of these areas of our business generates a vast array of data, some of it in real-time. Of course some of this data is an alert to which weed to rapidly react. But other data when analysed, provides very useful insights on performance.

Of course, not all metrics need to be measured real-time and so we take a view on how quickly certain pieces of information need to be updated.

So, for fun we built a financial dash board.  (Figures are made up):

In this example we have built a financial dash board. But we also have dashboards for our social media monitoring, client and development app server's, infrastructure and project build statuses.

For demo purposes, this one publically accessible, but we have highly secure private versions for sensitive information.

The dashboards are responsive and can be run from mobiles, tablets and desktops. We have a large screen in the office where this data is displayed all of the time.

##Want One?

We have had several companies expressed an interest in this extremley useful technology. So we have decided to make this available to all. Drop any of the team a line and we will have a chat on how we can help you become more aware 

Having insights on key business data in real-time is incredibly useful. In the age where everything is measurable and everything reportable, business intelligence of this type is invaluable.



Cheers,
Simon
