<p>This industry moves fast. You'll always have a new project to get excited about or a sudden problem in need of a creative solution.

<li dir="ltr">Write Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and more.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Be a business analyst, systems analyst, project manager, account handler, HTML expert, CSS guru, JavaScript wizard, back-end ninja, and database lumberjack. Often at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">What we're looking for…</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Expertise in front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Expertise in back-end web development (scripting languages, MVC frameworks, SQL)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Experience in cross-platform compatibility and responsive design (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Enthusiasm for test and behavior-driven development</li>
<li dir="ltr">Excellent problem solving skills</li>
<li dir="ltr">Strong verbal communication skills</li>
<li dir="ltr">Experience working in a small to mid-size company with an agile development process</li>
<li dir="ltr">Willingness to learn and be part of a fast-growing company</li>
<li dir="ltr">Be happy to work from our Tremough Campus, Penryn office in Cornwall</li>
<li dir="ltr">Own a Nerf gun</li>
</ul>
