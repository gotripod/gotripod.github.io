  content: I have migrated all my articles over from my old blog, however, in the
    process I have unfortunately lost the comments. Also all old articles are dated
    1st September 2007 to help the redirection rule for my old permalinks to find
    my new articles.

<p>With my new focus on Rails, I have decided to move my blog to the excellent <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto Blog</a>, from now on I will also be focusing my articles a little more towards not only Ruby on Rails but also Web Development, Web Design, UI Design and Javascript.</p>
<p>I have also used this opportunity to streamline the design of the site, there were a few things that didn't work quite as they should on the old site and will have been improved along with a revamp of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>As I write this <a href="http://www.miletbaker.com">www.miletbaker.com</a> still points to the old blog until all the content has been migrated and I have configured Apache to relay requests to my old urls to their new location. Once this is complete that will also be migrated across.</p>
<p><strike>Also look out for the Jive (Javascript Input Validation Engine) for Prototype which I am currently working on with <a href="http://lifeonrails.org">George</a> which will feature real time inline validation as well as validation calls via Ajax and a Rails plug in.</strike> Check out <a href="http://www.livevalidation.com/" target="_blank">Live Validation.</a></p>
