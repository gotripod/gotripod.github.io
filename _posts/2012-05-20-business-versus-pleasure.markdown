<p>When we formed Go Tripod we did it for some pretty straightforward reasons - we wanted to work together on a business that would make us some money while making us happy. I think that we've done pretty well for the first two-and-bit years; Jon and Mrs Helen Baker have brought Max into the world to join young Louis; I've met the amazing <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/callyillustrate">@callyillustrate</a>, and tomorrow, Simon and his fiancee Leona are tying the knot at <a href="http://www.stmichaelshotel.co.uk/">St Michaels in Falmouth</a>.</p>
<p>Having known both of them for so long it makes the Go Tripod team stupidhappy to see this happen - though we have work to draw us together we need some love to bind us. Jon's taking some photos that we'll post in a few weeks but in the meantime I hope you'll help us celebrate with Simon & Leona on their special day!</p>
