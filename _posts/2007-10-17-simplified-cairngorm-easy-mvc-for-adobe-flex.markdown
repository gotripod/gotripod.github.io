title: Simplified Cairngorm, Easy MVC for Adobe Flex

excerpt: ! 'Like many others, I have been struggling to fully get my head fully around
  the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm">Cairngorm Micro Architecture</a>,
  and even with the excellent <a href="http://www.tylerbeck.com/CairngormCreator/">Cairngorm
  Creator</a>, I find it a little overkill for many Adobe Flex projects I am involved
  with, in fact, <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/swebster/archives/2006/08/why_i_think_you.cfm">so
  does Steven Webster</a> (one of the creators of Cairngorm).


  So yesterday I sat in on an excellent Adobe eSeminar, presented by <a href="http://www.searchcoders.com/">Tom
  Bray of SearcherCoders</a> who presented an easy / simplified Model View Controller
  architecture based on Cairngorm.


  To demonstrate the need for these frameworks, Tom started with an excellent example
  of an application based on a simple chat client. Inspired by his excellent <a href="http://www.chatopica.com/">Chatopica</a>

  content: ! 'Hi Shanon,


    Thank you for your point of view. Firstly, I understand the concerns regarding
    singletons. And I agree that in my example, from my articles on extending EasyMVC
    I have used Singletons for my services which possibly could lead to problems of
    extendability in the future, however I stand by the fact a singleton should be
    used to access these services, via a singleton servicelocator (which is the widely
    agreed approach to locator patterns). This locator creates instances and provides
    access to the relevant services rather thank accessing them directly. As for the
    models in the example above, (this uses a modellocator pattern), the ChatModel
    is a modellocator to the Data Transfer Objects / Value Objects which can actually
    make testing easier as the test data can be easily injected via the modellocator
    from within the test rig, and I have used this approach using FlexUnit.


    Again I want to clarify that this article puts forward a simple framework that
    can be used where Cairngorm or PureMVC is overkill. This article was originally
    presented after Tom Brays Adobe eSeminar was not recorded and has proved to be
    a very popular approach. It is also designed to allow a fairly trivial upgrade
    to Cairngorm if needed and my articles on extending EasyMVC are a step towards
    that.


    I also want to clarify that these extending articles are designed to help understand
    how frameworks like Cairngorm work. I have come accross a lot of developers that
    are new to Flex come across Cairngorm and implement it without fully understanding
    it. EasyMVC works well (I use it regularly) where Cairngorm is overkill. Tom could
    have created a custom eventDispatcher as Caingorm does and then registered event
    listeners against that but for the sake of simplicity I agree with Tom Bray comments
    regarding the use of UIComponent.


    But like I say the use of design patterns are subjective, their use should depends
    on the software architects professional judgment, based on the project  and project
    team, not opinions on the web. Although there are always arguments for and against
    there are no hard and fast rules.'

  content: ! 'I thought this was a good way to introduce the concept of MVC, however
    I really disagree with the widespread use of singletons.


    How do you plan to test your controller when it gets more complex? How are you
    going to mock the model for testing purposes?


    For more information on the appropriate use of singletons please read this article
    http://www.softwarereality.com/design/singleton.jsp


    I also agree with tim that you shouldn''t need to extend from UIComponent, i''d
    prefer to see a seperate MVC event dispatcher (in which case a singleton is appropriate)
    used to dispatch and consume these custom events.'

  content: ! 'Sounds like shanon is well versed in singleton theory. The method Jon
    used to create his singleton is very commonly used in Actionscript.


    Even if a private constructor were allowed in Actionsctipt, you''d be able to
    instantiate two instances of a "singleton" from inside the class itself.  If you
    didn''t use the getInstance() method (as suggested in your comment), then you
    wouldn''t be abiding by the singleton''s contract to begin with.


    Regarding singletons in Actionscript, there has been more of a trend toward using
    singleton enforcers to compensate for the lack of a private constructor.'

  content: ! 'Hey Jon,


    These are some great examples for setting up a lightweight framework for applications
    utilizing the MVC pattern. Thanks for putting them out there!


    However, i think it is a mistake to say that the systemManager acts the same as
    the FrontContoller/CairngormEvent/CairngormEventDispatcher mechanism of the Ciarngorm
    framework. The FrontController is not added to the display list of an application
    built on the Ciarngorm framework and commands are executed based on the EventDispatcher
    instance of the CairngormEventDispatcher (CED) delegate.


    As such, since the SystemManager manages an application window, you may run into
    problems using EasyMVC effectively with modular Flex/AS applications and AIR applications.


    That is not to say that EasyMVC does not have its place, and i would certiainly
    use it in some cases :) Just a little info to think about prior to building modular
    or windowed apps. However, as you have said and pointed out in this great series
    is that it is not much work to switch over to the Cairngorm framework if you do
    find that the application needs it down the line.'

  content: I was just throwing in the EventDispatcher point in case it did need to
    dispatch events. I'd be interested in seeing what the arguments are for UIComponent.
    I still extending UIComponent is pulling in a lot of inherited code that really
    isn't needed. The controller isn't a view component. You could always pass a reference
    to the main view, listen for creation complete or what I've done in some cases
    is to create a public init() function which the main view could call once the
    creationComplete event fires. I also think it would be fine to add event listeners
    to the systemManager before the creationComplete event. Unless there's some case
    that Tom ran into of course where this didn't work. Is the presentation available
    online? Maybe I should watch it before commenting more :)

  content: ! 'Hi Jon,


    Yes I agree that the service locator and model locator patterns can be VERY useful.


    I would like to clarify that theChatModel presented is in fact NOT a singleton.
    If I never call the getInstance() method I can create as many instances I like:


    var chatOne:ChatModel = new ChatModel();

    var chatTwo:ChatModel = new ChatModel();


    And even if it were a singleton I think using static variables would haven been
    a lot simpler.


    e.g. ChatModel.currentActivity = ChatModel.VIEWING_CHAT;


    Now lets say I want to expand on the example and add the ability to join more
    than one room at once. You simply can''t do it with the chat model as a singelton.
    Yes you can tell me that you dont need to do this for the purposes of this example,
    but I''d tell you that anyone who has a need for MVC isn''t developing a one room
    chat application. And since when was a singleton recommended for the Model in
    MVC?'

    There is a good reason why Tom extends UIComponent, as he is well aware of the

    I think it is to do with being able to listen to the creationComplete event, as
    eventListeners need to be added to the systemManager at this point.


    Also to clarify the controller does not dispatch any events it is purely there
    to listen for them.

  content: ! 'Lo all,


    Great explanations on this site. Been trying out the EasyMVC method, coming from
    Cairngorm, and I like it a lot. I ran into one problem though and I hope that
    posting it here will help me fix it.


    I let the controller extend UIComponent. Add it and every event I dispatch runs
    fine. E.g. clicking a button fires a command, no problems there.

    Where it goes wrong is when i wanted to fire a e.g. StartApplicationEvent directly
    after my main view component fires it''s ''creationComplete''. What happens then
    is that the systemManager does not receive the event. It just does nothing. The
    events on the buttons work, because they get dispatched later on.


    What I don''t get is, that the controller is initted BEFORE i use the creationComplete
    to dispatch the AppStart event. putting a trace(systemManager) just before that
    dispatch does not return null. But still the event doesn''t reach the controller
    :S.


    Any ideas?


    Tnx, Ben'

  content: ! 'Jon,


    Still having issues with when the controller is handling events correctly or not.
    I use the creationComplete or addedToStage events inside the controller to initialize
    the listeners. Inside my main app I use the creationComplete to dispatch a certain
    event (which should be handled by the controller). It never reaches the controller
    it seems? If I use a button''s click handler to fire that same event moments later,
    it is handled correctly. What am i missing here? It seems the controller is initted
    too late. But if I add trace statements to the controller and creationComplete
    of the mainview, it does trace it''s init first and dispatch after.... tracing
    the systemManager in the init of the controller says it''s NOT null...I''m fresh
    out of ideas here...

    There is nothing to download with EasyMVC it is simply a process the classes that
    need to be setup (controller) can easily be cut and pasted from the blog.. That''s
    about it.

<p>Like many others, I have been struggling to fully get my head fully around the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm">Cairngorm Micro Architecture</a>, and even with the excellent <a href="http://www.tylerbeck.com/CairngormCreator/">Cairngorm Creator</a>, I find it a little overkill for many Adobe Flex projects I am involved with, in fact, <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/swebster/archives/2006/08/why_i_think_you.cfm">so does Steven Webster</a> (one of the creators of Cairngorm).</p>
<p>So yesterday I sat in on an excellent Adobe eSeminar, presented by <a href="http://www.searchcoders.com/">Tom Bray of SearcherCoders</a> who presented an easy / simplified Model View Controller architecture based on Cairngorm.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the need for these frameworks, Tom started with an excellent example of an application based on a simple chat client. Inspired by his excellent <a href="http://www.chatopica.com/">Chatopica</a> perhaps?:<br />

<li> <span class="ta">&lt;/mx:ViewStack&gt;</span></li>
<li><span class="ta">&lt;/mx:Application&gt;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The above example application is a classic example of how most of us start out developing in Flex, we end up putting all our properties and event handlers in the same file. This may be fine for a tiny application but if we want to scale it up we are going to run into problems.</p>
<p>For example, Flex offers us the ability to create a custom <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MXML</span></span> component, that we can then reuse through our application, so as Tom showed, maybe we want to take the code that displays the Room list (above) and copy this into a separate mxml component . We can easily cut and paste the code and create a new <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MXML</span></span> file RoomList.mxml with the following code:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="pp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span></li>
<li><span class="ta">&lt;mx:Panel</span> <span class="an">title</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">Room List</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">xmlns:mx</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">width</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">300</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">height</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">400</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><span class="ta">&gt;</span></li>

<li>    <span class="ta">&lt;mx:Button</span> <span class="an">width</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">100%</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">label</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">Chat</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">enabled</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">{roomList.selectedItem != null}</span><span class="dl">"</span></span></li>
<li>            <span class="an">click</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">joinRoom(roomList.selectedItem as String)</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></li>
<li>  <span class="ta">&lt;/mx:VBox&gt;</span></li>
<li><span class="ta">&lt;/mx:Panel&gt;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that we now have introduced two errors as the ArrayCollection ‚Äòrooms‚Äô is no longer in this mxml file then we cannot bind to it as the dataProvider for the roomList, also the event handler ‚ÄòjoinRoom‚Äô is no longer accessible. We could move these into this file, but then they couldn‚Äôt access the view stack and the problem goes on. So what we really need is to centralise our data into a central model and also centralise our even handlers into a controller.</p>
<h2>Centralising Data into a Model</h2>
<p>To centralise data, Tom took the Cairngorm‚Äôs modelLocator pattern, based around a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton pattern</a> . Where by the singleton ensures there is only ever one instance of itself, we define our Model as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="r">package</span> com.chatopica.chat.model</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>  <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">class</span> ChatModel</li>
<li>  {</li>
<li>    <span class="r">private</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">var</span> instance:ChatModel;</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">function</span> ChatModel()</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      <span class="r">if</span>( instance != <span class="pc">null</span> )</li>
<li>      {</li>
<li>        <span class="r">throw</span>( new Error( <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">there can be only one instance of ChatModel</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> ) );</li>
<li>      }</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">function</span> getInstance():ChatModel</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      <span class="r">if</span>( instance == <span class="pc">null</span> )</li>
<li>      {</li>
<li>        instance = new ChatModel();</li>
<li>      }</li>
<li>      <span class="r">return</span> instance;</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>  }</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a typical singleton, implemented in ActionScript 3. As Tom pointed out in the eSeminar, ActionScript does not allow for private constructors, so here he is throwing an error if we try and instantiate the class and it is already instantiated. We can now access this Model anywhere in our application by simply typing</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li>ChatModel.getInstance()</li>
</ol>
<p>So the next thing to do is move our ArrayCollection rooms into the Model so we end up with the following:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="r">package</span> com.chatopica.chat.model</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> mx.collections.ArrayCollection;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">class</span> ChatModel</li>
<li>  {</li>
<li>    <span class="r">private</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">var</span> instance:ChatModel;</li>
<li>    [Bindable]</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">var</span> rooms:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection( [ new Room(<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">Flex</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>), new Room(<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">Flash</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>), new Room(<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k"><span class="caps">AIR</span></span><span class="dl">"</span></span>), new Room(<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">ColdFusion</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>) ] );</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">function</span> ChatModel()</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      <span class="r">if</span>( instance != <span class="pc">null</span> )</li>
<li>      {</li>
<li>        <span class="r">throw</span>( new Error( <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">there can be only one instance of ChatModel</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> ) );</li>
<li>      }</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">function</span> getInstance():ChatModel</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      <span class="r">if</span>( instance == <span class="pc">null</span> )</li>
<li>      {</li>
<li>        instance = new ChatModel();</li>
<li>      }</li>
<li>      <span class="r">return</span> instance;</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>  }</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p>Because our ArrayCollection is now in the Model that we can access from anywhere. We can change the mx:List ‚ÄòroomList‚Äô in RoomList.mxml to use the rooms ArrayCollection in the Model as the dataProvider as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="ta">&lt;mx:List</span> <span class="an">id</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">roomList</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">width</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">100%</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">height</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">100%</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>  <span class="an">borderSides</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">top</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">dataProvider</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">{ChatModel.getInstance().rooms}</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We have now fixed the first issue but we still have the issue of the click handler for the button being inaccessible. We can solve this by centralising our events into a Controller</p>
<h2>Centralising Events into a Controller</h2>
<p>As with many event driven languages, ActionScript has a handy feature known as event bubbling. When an event is fired in a container, if the event has been set to bubble (by default events don‚Äôt bubble) it will also fire on it‚Äôs parent container, and in turn fire on the grandparent container all the way up to the main Application <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MXML</span></span> class. By bubbling events, we can register event listeners on the System Manager and listen for any global application events that are set to bubble. So we can dispatch an event anywhere in our application using the following, and we can listen for it on the System Manager:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li>dispatchEvent(new Event(<span class="s"><span class="dl">‚Äò</span><span class="k">myEvent</span><span class="dl">‚Äò</span></span>, <span class="pc">true</span>))</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> We have set the second parameter (bubbles) on the Event constructor to true, which tells the event dispatcher to bubble this event.</p>
<p>As we are centralising our events we may need to send related information along with the event, for use by the event handler. For example, as the event handler is no longer able to directly query the roomList, to see which item has been selected (i.e. roomList.selectedItem), we need to send this information with the event. We can easily do this by creating a custom event that extends the Event class as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="r">package</span> com.chatopica.chat.events</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> com.chatopica.chat.model.Room;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> flash.events.Event;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">class</span> JoinRoomEvent <span class="r">extends</span> Event</li>
<li>  {</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">const</span> JOIN:<span class="pt">String</span> = <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">joinRoom</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>;</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">var</span> room:Room;</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">function</span> JoinRoomEvent( room:Room )</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      <span class="pc">super</span>( <span class="caps">JOIN</span>, <span class="pc">true</span> );</li>
<li>      <span class="pc">this</span>.room = room;</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>  }</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p>Above we have simply extended the event using inheritance and have added a public property called room (of type Room, Tom has created a Room class that holds the name as well as a collection of Users). We have also declared the event name/type as a constant <span class="caps"><span class="caps">JOIN</span></span> = ‚ÄújoinRoom‚Äù. This allows us to reference this event anywhere. In our constructor, we call the constructor on the parent class (Event) setting the event name/type to ‚ÄújoinRoom‚Äù and stating that it should bubble (like this we don‚Äôt have to specify that it bubbles when we create a new JoinRoomEvent). We then set the room property from the parameter passed to the constructor.</p>
<p>So now we can fire a JoinRoomEvent anywhere in our application, passing in a room object. The event handler listening for this event will have access to this room object. So we can fix the last error in RoomList.mxml as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="ta">&lt;mx:Button</span> <span class="an">width</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">100%</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">label</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">Chat</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">enabled</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">{roomList.selectedItem != null}</span><span class="dl">"</span></span></li>
<li>      <span class="an">click</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">dispatchEvent( new JoinRoomEvent( roomList.selectedItem as Room ) )</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>So far we have created a custom event and we have discussed where to look to find bubbling events but we have not looked at how to do this.</p>
<h2>The Controller</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, we can listen to all events that have been set to bubble on the systemManager and as UIComponent (anyone who has created a custom component will know this one) has a reference to systemManager within it, we can extend this class. The other benefit of extending UIComponent for our class that will be our central event handler or Controller is that we can then use it in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MXML</span></span>.</p>
<p>We extend the UIComponent as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="r">package</span> com.chatopica.chat.controller</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> com.chatopica.chat.events.JoinRoomEvent;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> com.chatopica.chat.events.SendMessageEvent;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> com.chatopica.chat.model.ChatModel;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> flash.events.Event;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> mx.core.UIComponent;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">import</span> mx.events.FlexEvent;</li>
<li>  <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">class</span> ChatController <span class="r">extends</span> UIComponent</li>
<li>  {</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">function</span> ChatController()</li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      addEventListener( FlexEvent.CREATION_COMPLETE, setupEventListeners );</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>    <span class="r">private</span> <span class="r">function</span> setupEventListeners( <span class="pt">event</span>:Event ):<span class="r">void</span></li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      systemManager.addEventListener( JoinRoomEvent.JOIN, handle_joinRoom );</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>    <span class="r">private</span> <span class="r">function</span> handle_joinRoom( <span class="pt">event</span>:JoinRoomEvent ):<span class="r">void</span></li>
<li>    {</li>
<li>      ChatModel.getInstance().currentActivity = ChatModel.VIEWING_CHAT;</li>
<li>    }</li>
<li>  }</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note::</em> Above we have not directly added an event listener to the systemManager in the ChatController constructor. In fact we can‚Äôt to do this, because at the time the class is instantiated the systemManager is not initialised and is Null. We would therefore be adding an event listener to nothing. We get around this by adding an event listener for the global FlexEvent.CREATION_COMPLETE event, and at that point we can then add our event handler(s) to the systemManager.</p>
<h2>Controlling the View Stack</h2>
<p>The final thing we have left to achieve is the ability to change the View Stack from the controller, we first need to store the currentActivity or state in the Model as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">const</span> VIEWING_CHAT:<span class="pt">String</span> = <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">viewingChat</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>;</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">static</span> <span class="r">const</span> VIEWING_ROOMS:<span class="pt">String</span> = <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">viewingRooms</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>;</li>
<li>    [Bindable]</li>
<li>    <span class="r">public</span> <span class="r">var</span> currentActivity:<span class="pt">String</span>;</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the currentActivity property above, we have also added a constant value for each state. Unfortunately it is not as simple as binding this property to the mx:ViewStack, but that does not mean it isn‚Äôt easy. All we have to use is the ChangeWatcher class that monitors a property and fires and event when it changes. We do this in the file MainView.mxml that holds out viewstack as follows:</p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="pp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span></li>
<li><span class="ta">&lt;mx:ViewStack</span> <span class="an">xmlns:mx</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">resizeToContent</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">true</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">xmlns:views</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">com.chatopica.chat.views.</span><span class="dl"><strong>"</strong></span></span><span class="ta"><strong>&gt;</strong></span></li>
<li><strong>  <span class="ta">&lt;mx:Script&gt;</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>    <span class="er">&lt;</span>![CDATA[</strong></li>
<li><strong>      import mx.events.PropertyChangeEvent;</strong></li>
<li><strong>      import mx.binding.utils.ChangeWatcher;</strong></li>
<li><strong>      import com.chatopica.chat.model.ChatModel;</strong></li>
<li><strong>      </strong></li>
<li><strong> private var activityWatcher:ChangeWatcher = ChangeWatcher.watch( ChatModel.getInstance(), "currentActivity", handle_activityChange );</strong></li>
<li><strong>      </strong></li>
<li><strong>      private function handle_activityChange( event:PropertyChangeEvent ):void</strong></li>
<li><strong>      {</strong></li>
<li><strong>        if( event.newValue == ChatModel.VIEWING_CHAT )</strong></li>
<li><strong>        {</strong></li>
<li><strong>          selectedChild = chatPanel;</strong></li>
<li><strong>        }</strong></li>
<li><strong>      }</strong></li>
<li><strong>    ]]<span class="er">&gt;</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>  <span class="ta">&lt;/mx:Script&gt;</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>      </strong></li>
<li><strong>  <span class="ta">&lt;views:RoomList</span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>  </strong></li>
<li><span class="ta"><strong>&lt;/mx:ViewStack&gt;</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>    </strong><strong>Now, when the value of currentActivity in the ChatModel changes, Flex will dispatch a PropertyChangedEvent. We can then listen for this event and change the view, accessing what the new value of currentActivity is in the newValue property of the PropertyChangeEvent (shown above as event.newValue).</strong></p>
<p><strong>    </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Refactor the rest of your application‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><strong>    </strong><strong>Having done this for the RoomList component, we can now repeat the process for the code that implements the chat window. Finally we are simply left with the following in our mx:Application tags:</strong></p>
<ol class="CodeRay">
<li><span class="pp"><strong>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</strong></span></li>
<li><span class="ta"><strong>&lt;mx:Application</strong></span><strong> <span class="an">xmlns:mx</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">layout</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">vertical</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> <span class="an">xmlns:views</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">com.chatopica.chat.views.</span></span></strong><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="an">xmlns:controller</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">com.chatopica.chat.controller.*</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><span class="ta">&gt;</span></li>
<li>    <span class="ta">&lt;controller:ChatController</span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></li>
<li>    <span class="ta">&lt;views:MainView</span><span class="ta">/&gt;</span></li>
<li><span class="ta">&lt;/mx:Application&gt;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This process now makes our code cleaner, loosely coupled and more <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRY</span></span> (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself), easy to scale and we can reuse these components without the risk of breaking our system.</p>
