<p>Adobe have today announced that they will be offering Flex builder 2 as a free download (at no cost) to education establishments and students. Not only a welcomed announcement by the community but also this shrewd move will mean more institutions teaching Rich Internet Application development, and more graduates ready to tackle the next generation of web applications and satisfy the growing demand for Flex developers. (Hopefully in time for the impending Rich Internet Application boom?)</p>
