We worked with Simon Francis of Falmor to build a cloud-based tool for the shipping industry. Laytime is the term in commercial shipping for the amount of time allowed in a voyage charter for the loading and unloading of cargo, and is traditionally heavily paper-based.

By developing an online application, we were able to streamline the process and provide consistently accurate calculations. The workflow that has been established allows documentation to be passed from shipping agents down to multiple third parties, with email notifications providing prompt feedback at each stage of the process.

This Ruby on Rails application incorporates a number of open source libraries and the Bootstrap framework in order to provide deep functionality in a favourable timeframe. We used a light Agile-like approach to iterate on our initial project specification and wireframe which enabled Falmor to get a product into the hands of potential clients and incorporate their feedback.

Greg's screen mockups were built using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and Colin and the technical team implemented a custom theme on top of Bootstrap to create a beautiful yet functional B2B system that is set to transform the shipping industry.
