As JavaScript and Ext JS experts, Go Tripod are often asked to build dynamic web applications for a range of clients, and when one of the world's largest content delivery companies came knocking, we were excited by the opportunity to shine.

We worked on two applications for LLNW and both enabled them to visualise and maintain their corporate structure, which was powered by an LDAP setup. We communicated with a server-side API to display and amend information on their staff and sub-organisations, providing an interface for quick information retrieval and rapid changes to internal data.

We also created a graphical interface to display the hierarchy of Limelight's organisation; by building a custom drawing solution we were able to support older browsers and display an interactive, zoomable representation of any part of Limelight's international operation.

Go Tripod were selected for the task due to our extensive Ext JS knowledge, and we combined that with some bespoke code to build applications that were both usable *and* useful!
