When Joe Reevy from Best Practice Online Ltd needed a content distribution platform to allow him to push up to date news to his client base of legal firm he came to us.

LegalRSS was developed to solve a problem at large on the internet. How do you keep the content on them up to date and relevant?
Best Practice Online are a leading content provider for the legal sector and they came to us wanting to solve this very problem. We found an elegant solution and developed LegalRSS using a selection of cutting edge technologies from our toolbox.

LegalRSS allows Joe to manage content and subscribers and publish content to their network of partner websites.
Integration with is easy for LegalRSSâ€™ users who simply need to install a few lines of Javascript on their website to immediately start displaying up to date news content. Advanced users can can also use the standard RSS or ATOM protocols to be fed content directly from Best Practice Online Ltd.

This bespoke Ruby on Rails system has been in constant development for several years, and our iterative approach to its development has allowed Legal RSS to continually improve its feature set to meet customer expectations. We augmented the website with a custom iOS app which can be branded to suit any existing Legal RSS customer.
