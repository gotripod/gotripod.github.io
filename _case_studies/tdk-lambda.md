Go Tripod's team have worked with TDK-Lambda for several years, building a strategic partnership to provide hosted software solutions. TDK-Lambda provide AC-DC power supplies, DC-DC converters and EMC/EMI filters, and their website offering is an important part of this. It brings content to seven countries, fully translated and customised to provide the best experience for each territory. Backed by a custom content management solution, this website represents years of collaboration between Go Tripod and TDK-Lambda, to create a service which is used by staff across the world.

As well as ongoing development of the platform, we work closely with the TDK-Lambda marketing team to provide ongoing support, SEO services, and hosting - the complete package.
