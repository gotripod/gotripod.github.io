Iron Mountain had big plans for their internal systems and needed to build a big team to match. By bringing in Go Tripod's JavaScript skills - specifically our Ext JS expertise - they were able to augment their existing development force and hit the ground running.

As part of a large team, and under the scrum management methodology, we worked remotely with designers, developers and stakeholders to develop an Ext JS app from scratch. We provided coding expertise, code review and architecture services as a small part of a fantastic working group.
